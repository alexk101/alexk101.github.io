## Conference: Quantum Information for Mathematics, Economics, and Statistics

This summer, I will be working at Argonne National Laboratory as part of the Science Undergraduate Laboratory Internship (SULI) program. As part of this program, I will be working under Dr. Martin Suchara, a scientist in the Mathematics and Computer Science division at Argonne National Laboratory and at the Pritzker School of Molecular Engineering at the University of Chicago. As part of this program, I will be working on further developing quantum network simulation software. This software, called SeQUeNCe, will be used for the modeling and prototyping of real metropolitan networks.

Though the program starts on June 1st, I was encourage by my advisor to attend a conference held by the [Insitute for Mathematical and Statistical Innovation](https://www.imsi.institute/) to strengthen my understanding of quantum computing. In the following post, I hope to highlight some of the interesting concepts that I gleaned from the presenters of the conference. As this is my first real foray into the quantum realm, many of the topics here will be quite basic, and simply serve to highlight core concepts that I wish to understand further in depth.

## The Beginning

This is the first of, hopefully, a number of posts on this website to track the things going on in my academic, professional, and personal life. My intent with this website it to serve and a means of improving my understanding of various technologies, algorithms, etc by writing about them, as well as my writing and research skills. I will aim to keep this blog semi-professional, as I want it to be something that doesn't blacklist me from the industry, but still something that I enjoy writing. That means yes, there will be many bad jokes, memes, and silly things that I want to include in here as well. With that, I will conclude this introductory post and begin thinking about what kind of joke to include at the bottom of this post.

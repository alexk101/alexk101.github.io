As part of this program, I will be working under Dr. Martin Suchara, a scientist in the Mathematics and Computer Science division at Argonne National Laboratory and at the Pritzker School of Molecular Engineering at the University of Chicago. As part of this program, I will be working on further developing quantum network simulation software.</description></item><item><title>The Beginning</title><link>https://alexk101.github.io/the-beginning/</link><pubDate>Mon, 24 May 2021 23:53:21 -0500</pubDate><guid>https://alexk101.github.io/the-beginning/</guid><description>The Beginning This is the first of, hopefully, a number of posts on this website to track the things going on in my academic, professional, and personal life. My intent with this website it to serve and a means of improving my understanding of various technologies, algorithms, etc by writing about them, as well as my writing and research skills. I will aim to keep this blog semi-professional, as I want it to be something that doesn&amp;rsquo;t blacklist me from the industry, but still something that I enjoy writing.</description></item></channel></rss>

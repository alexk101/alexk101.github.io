My intent with this website it to serve and a means of improving my understanding of various technologies, algorithms, etc by writing about them, as well as my writing and research skills. I will aim to keep this blog semi-professional, as I want it to be something that doesn&amp;rsquo;t blacklist me from the industry, but still something that I enjoy writing.</description></item></channel></rss>
